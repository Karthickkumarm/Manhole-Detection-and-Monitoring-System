# Manhole-Detection-and-Monitoring-System
# Problem Statement:
In urban areas, manholes are an essential part of the sewage and drainage system.
However, the lack of proper maintenance and inspection of manholes can lead to hazardous
situations like accidents and even fatalities. The problem is even more severe during the
rainy season when the overflowing of sewage water can cause severe health hazards. To
address this issue, there is a need for an efficient and reliable manhole detection system that
can monitor the status of manholes and alert the concerned authorities in case of any
abnormalities. The system should be capable of detecting the presence of gas, water level,
and any other hazardous substances in the manhole. To develop such a system, the
integration of IoT, Arduino, gas sensor, and float sensor can be utilized. The system should
be designed to continuously monitor the manholes and provide real-time information about
the status of the manholes. Additionally, an alert system should be incorporated that can
notify the relevant authorities in case of any emergency. Therefore, the problem statement
is to develop a manhole detection system using IoT, Arduino, gas sensor, and float sensor
that can efficiently monitor the status of manholes, detect hazardous substances, and alert
the authorities in case of any emergency.
